# Blog site using mongo and ejs

Its another version of my flagship site vinyl vue, but this one uses EJS, Mongo, and many user authentication features.

To test, create a mongo bucket of your own, and use it to see how routing, and APIs are used herein. EJS is used as templating engine. while i acknowledge that it is somewhat obsolete now, this was mainly to test my
backend efforts and frontend is given little weightage. 

to use:

1) clone
2) npm i to install all dependencies
3) create mongo atlas credentials and create documents
4) enter the entry point. create an account, and test the login features on your own.
